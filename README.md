# How to use the code?
* Execute Video.py to get live input from webcam. Press “q” key to stop webcam. Make sure the edges of the paper as well as digits written were not hidden, while recording.    
* To execute the code open main_detector.py and run it. This would auto import cnn.py, model.pth, directory.xlsx and img.jpg. The name associated with phone number would be printed.
* If the number is not available on directory the stage 3 would be auto activated. It would print the largest possible number from input digits.
* If you run into error of importing library, kindly run installation.py.
